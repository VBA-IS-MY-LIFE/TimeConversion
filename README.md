# TimeConversion
It's a functionality for converting time-values into Decimal Values

You can determine an area within an Excel-Sheet for this functionality.

Also, you can determine the delimiter. If you change it into something like "-" or ",", it could cause trouble.


Maybe it's useful for Time-Sheets.
