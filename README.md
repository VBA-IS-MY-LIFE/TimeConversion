# TimeConversion
It's a functionality for converting time-values into Decimal Values.

You can determine an area within an Excel-Sheet for this functionality.

Also, you can determine the delimiter. If you change it into something like "-" or ",", it could cause trouble.

It's useful for Time-Sheets.

As you can see, it's an event for "Worksheet_Change". So, you should put it into the Table-Class. I used Table(1).
